This code will render a **flowchart** when viewed on GitHub.

### How Mermaid Works in GitHub:
- When GitHub detects a block of code labeled with `mermaid` (as shown above), it uses the Mermaid JavaScript library to convert the code into an interactive diagram or flowchart.
- This is dynamic and rendered in the **browser** as a visual representation of the text-based structure you defined in your Mermaid code.
- GitHub will automatically generate the diagram when you push the Markdown file to your repository and view it through GitHub's web interface.

### Supported Diagrams in Mermaid:
Mermaid supports a variety of diagram types, including:
- **Flowcharts** (like the example above)
- **Sequence Diagrams**
- **Gantt Charts**
- **Class Diagrams**
- **State Diagrams**
- **Pie Charts**
- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**

Here’s an example for a **sequence diagram**:

```markdown
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Hi Alice, I'm good, thanks!
